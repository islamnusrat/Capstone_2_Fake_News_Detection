The recent growth of fake news on social media has a great impact on society. There is a lot of information from disparate sources among various users around the world and developing a technique to detect fake news has become a necessity in this era of social media. The aim of this project is to develop a model that can detect fake news. In order to achieve this Twitter data has been used from Kaggle. The dataset consists of two categories of labelled data True News and Fake News. Essentially this is a supervised classification task.
